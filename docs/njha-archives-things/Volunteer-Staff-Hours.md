## The paper drawer on the printer won't shut!

Pull out the drawer entirely, off of the little rails (you may need to lift it a bit). Check behind the drawer for paper that may have gotten stuck there.

# Common Questions

## Where can I get a website made?

Although the OCF only offers web hosting, student group representatives may come in looking for front-end web development. There are a few organizations on-campus you can redirect them to:

* Innovative Design
  * <https://linktr.ee/innodatcal>
  * ASUC-chartered organization
  * Their offices are in (placeholder but somewhere in MLK)
  * also does design and photography services
  * free for berkeley clubs!!!
* Web Development @ Berkeley (WDB)
  * <https://www.webatberkeley.org/work-with-us>

## Tips

It can be beneficial to sit near the opstaff desk so when people ask them for help, you can step in and opstaff can continue checking cards.
